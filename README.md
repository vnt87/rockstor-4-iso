# rockstor-4-iso

## This is now obsolete, Rockstor has [official ISOs](https://rockstor.com/dls.html) up for various platform now so we don't need to build our own anymore. I will be archiving this repo.

Contains an unofficial iso for rockstor 4, built using the default [Rockstor 4 Installer Recipe](https://github.com/rockstor/rockstor-installer).
It is always recommended to follow the official installer recipe if you want the latest version.
